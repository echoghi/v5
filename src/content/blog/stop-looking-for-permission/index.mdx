If you’re reading this, it’s probably because you found my site on GitHub or through a search engine while looking for an answer to something coding-related. You’re likely a software engineer, or at least adjacent to the field. And if that’s the case, you already know how difficult it has become to land a programming job, and how it only seems to be getting worse.

People in tech often joke that interviews are harder than the actual job, and the joke feels increasingly accurate. You spend months preparing to solve obscure trivia about your programming language of choice, along with endless permutations of popular algorithms designed to test your computer science knowledge far beyond what you’ll likely encounter day to day.

That’s all assuming you make it past the recruiter and the behavioral interviews, where you’re evaluated on whether you’re a “culture fit” and sufficiently enthusiastic about the privilege of working for the company. That is, of course, if you hear back from your initial application at all, which is statistically unlikely.

A couple of years ago, a cynical thought occurred to me: it would probably be easier to make \$10,000 per month building my own online business than by getting hired as a programmer. I figured that if you redirected all the time and energy spent grinding LeetCode and submitting applications into actually building things, you could earn a programmer’s salary on your own faster than you could get a job. So I stopped applying, sent recruiter emails straight to spam, and started building ideas.

At first, my only goal was to make a single dollar online. If I could do that, it would prove that earning money independently was possible. And if I could make one dollar, why not \$100? With enough effort and ingenuity, \$100 could become \$1,000, and so on.

Eight months and six websites later, I surpassed \$10,000 in a single month. Three months after that, I hit \$20,000. As I write this, I’m on track to exceed \$30,000, roughly three times my highest monthly income as a senior software engineer.

Yet if I dropped everything today and tried to get hired again, I’d likely be ignored, rejected, or told I wasn’t good enough. The lesson feels obvious in hindsight: if you’re a programmer with real skills, don’t build a future that depends on someone else’s permission to earn a living. Build for yourself.
