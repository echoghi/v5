When I started building <a href="https://catcafemap.com/cat-cafes" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Cat Cafe Map</a>, I really wanted to keep things as minimal and fast as possible. No unnecessary frameworks, no giant libraries, just a clean site that loads quickly and feels light.

Most of the pages are statically rendered, and I barely touch JavaScript thanks to [Astro Islands](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/islands). My first version shipped under 10kb of JavaScript per page, which felt great. But there was one thing bugging me: my font file. The `woff2` file came in at 33kb, which made it three times bigger than the JS payload. Not the end of the world, but it definitely felt unnecessary.

So I decided to trim it down. I added a little build step to subset the font so it only included the glyphs I actually use across the site. To do that, I hacked together a Bash script that scanned through the `dist` folder, collected all the characters used, and passed them into `fonttools` to generate a slimmer font file.

The difference was pretty satisfying. The font went from 33kb down to about 10kb, which is roughly a 70% reduction. It doesn't make a huge difference, but it’s a small optimization that makes the site snappier and keeps bandwidth usage lower.

Here’s a simple example of how I did it using Bash, Python, and fonttools:

```bash title="process-fonts.sh" caption="Creating font subsets via fonttools"
#!/bin/bash

# Check and install dependencies
check_and_install_dependencies() {
    # Check for pip
    if ! command -v pip &> /dev/null; then
        echo "pip is not installed. Please install Python and pip first."
        exit 1
    fi

    # Check for fonttools and brotli
    if ! python3 -c "import fontTools" &> /dev/null || ! python3 -c "import brotli" &> /dev/null; then
        echo "Installing required Python packages..."
        pip install fonttools brotli
    fi
}

BUILD_DIR="./dist" # adjust this to your build directory
# Directory containing your fonts

# Output directory for subsetted fonts
SUBSET_DIR="./public/fonts"

# Create subset directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p "$SUBSET_DIR"

# Function to extract text content from files
extract_text() {
    # Extract text from HTML, JS, CSS files
    find "$BUILD_DIR" -type f \( -name "*.html" -o -name "*.js" -o -name "*.css" \) -exec cat {} + | \
    # Remove HTML tags
    sed 's/<[^>]*>//g' | \
    # Remove special characters but keep unicode
    tr -cd '[:alnum:][:space:][:punct:]\\u0080-\\uffff' | \
    sort -u > /tmp/text_content.txt
}

# Create subsets for each font
create_subset() {
    local font=$1
    local basename=$(basename "$font")
    local output="$SUBSET_DIR/${basename%.*}.subset.${basename##*.}"

    echo "Creating subset for $basename..."

    pyftsubset "$font" \
        --output-file="$output" \
        --text-file=/tmp/text_content.txt \
        --layout-features='*' \
        --flavor=woff2 \
        --desubroutinize

    echo "Created subset font: $output"

    # Print size comparison
    original_size=$(stat -f %z "$font")
    subset_size=$(stat -f %z "$output")
    echo "Original size: $(($original_size/1024))KB"
    echo "Subset size: $(($subset_size/1024))KB"
    echo "Reduction: $((100-($subset_size*100/$original_size)))%"
}

echo "Cleaning up old subset fonts..."

echo "Extracting text content from build..."

echo "Creating font subsets..."
for font in "$FONTS_DIR"/*.woff2; do
    create_subset "$font"
done

echo "Cleanup..."
rm /tmp/text_content.txt

echo "Done! Subsetted fonts are in $SUBSET_DIR"
```
